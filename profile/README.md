# Next Big Studio 
Next Big Studio isn‚Äôt a real studio ‚Äî just a running joke that we‚Äôre the coolest indie team ever to touch a Unity project. Formed for the University of Houston‚Äôs COSC 4358 (Fall 2024), we couldn‚Äôt help but carry our chaotic game into COSC 4359 (Spring 2025) to finish what we started: Upgrade Your Bumper. As of May 2025, we are no longer pushing any updates to the game, but our GitHub and Itch.io pages might receive some updates here and there. Thank you to everyone who contributed to our projects!

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Will the repository for the 2025 version be made public?

No, simply because we have many assets that depend on other assets originating from the Unity Asset Store.
